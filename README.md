Verilog-based Car Parking System with FSM, 7-segment display, and vehicle counter logic
# Smart Car Parking System (Verilog FSM)

This project implements a smart car parking controller in **Verilog HDL** using a **Moore Finite State Machine (FSM)**. It handles vehicle entry/exit, password-based authentication, and displays system state on a 7-segment display.

## Features
 FSM-controlled access using 2-bit password
 Entry/exit detection via sensor inputs
 Vehicle count logic (max capacity: 20)
 Displays system states: "En", "60", "P5", "n0", "EE"

## Files
 parking_system1.v: Main Verilog module
